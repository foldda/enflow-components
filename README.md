# Foldda 'Handler' Framework
Foldda is a unique modular app-development framework and runtime service, where apps are assembled by stacking modules that are physically represented as folders. In a Foldda app, each folder encapsulates a specific function of a data-processing step, the parent-children relationship of the stacked folders is used for representing the processing's data flow. As such, Foldda app development is not only no-code but also requires "no tool", meaning, unlike the other no-code platforms, the development doesn't require using or learning a vendor-specific IDE, which means it requires less skill and cost to develop an app, also less effort in maintenance it.

Also, with other no-code platforms, while you can use the provided modules for building an app, normally there is no way for you to customize a module in the provided system, let alone to develop your module to be used in the system. In other words, you cannot have any special requirement if it isn't available as provided. 

Foldda is different. As you'll be supported by this GitHub repo, you can have your private customization of the existing Foldda modules, and you can develop your own modules based on your requirements.
